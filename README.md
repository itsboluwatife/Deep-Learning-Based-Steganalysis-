 
Steganalysis, the science of detecting hidden information embedded in digital media, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Traditional methods, often relying on hand-crafted features and statistical analysis, have shown limitations, leading researchers to explore more advanced techniques like deep learning models. This study introduces the development of a deep learning-based blind steganalysis model using SRNet, a specialized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model leverages the hierarchical feature extraction capabilities of SRNet, alongside traditional Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method to detect subtle patterns in images indicative of hidden data, and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique) was employed to balance the dataset and to prevent overfitting. However, it was found that GLCM, while effective for traditional machine learning, did not significantly improve the model’s performance. Results showed that SRNet’s internal feature extraction was fairly sufficient for accurate detection of steganographic content, significantly enhancing model accuracy with 50.22%
